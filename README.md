JuicyJS was designed to alleviate a lot of the problems I run into while prototyping Javascript games. Namely, most engines are way too complex for what I need, and the learning curve makes it more cumbersome to get something off the ground than necessary. In the end, I end up hacking together something basic in HTML5 anyway.

I created JuicyJS to compile the simplest HTML5 patterns that I find myself following, and hardly more. Instead, a lot of programming is left up to you to hack together, so you don't have to spend hours studying a new framework.

JuicyJS isn't a huge multi-platform, do-it-all game engine, and it won't be. Use something else that's more robust and designed with that in mind. JuicyJS is good for hacking together something for a game jam, when you want to hit the ground running.
